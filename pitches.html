<h1>Project Idea (re-pitched): Meet Barbie, the girl with 150+ careers</h1>

<h3>Barbie has been criticized for having an unrealistic body as well as materialistc and shallow. But can the 55-year-old Barbie, with the ability to reinvent herself with costume change, actually empower girls to broaden their horizon in terms of career options?</h3>

<p>
	Barbie, marketed to children between age 3 and 9, was first introduced by Mattel in 1959 and sold for $3. In the first year, 300,000 Barbie dolls were sold. The company went public in 1960. But in recent years, sales of Barbie (Mattel's biggest product line) has suffered from criticisms. Barbie nay-sayers see the toy as detrimental for young girls, including unrealistc body image and limited career goals. 
</p>

<p>But I would like to challenge that idea. </p>

<p>
	With over 150 career Barbie released to date -- occupations include dentist, flight attendant, nurse, surgeon and executive, the toy inspires girls to be more than just housewives. Selecting ten career Barbie, I will gather data of number of women in that occupation from 1960 to present. For example, for architect I will track the number of women in that profession annually. If my data shows growth in women architects, that would help support my hypothesis. 
</p>

<p>
	To find out whether or not my thesis is true, I will use data from <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">Burea of Labor Statistics</a>. Additioanlly, I will have to reserach scholarly articles commenting on the correlation of child play, toy and mental growth. It is probably helpful to speak to psychologists specializing in child development as well as woman study professors. 
</p>

<p>The piece will rely heavily on reserach. Also, I will have to use Excel tools learned from class to organize and compare data. </p>

<p>New skills include: access BLS archive, learn Illustrator and code a webpage from scratch. </p>

<p>
	SEC filings, 1994 to 2014 <a href="http://investor.shareholder.com/mattel/sec.cfm?DocType=Annual&Year=&FormatFilter=">(see link)</a>
</p>

<p>
	I will present my story as a blog post, and visualize my data as bascic bar graphs. 
</p>
	
<p>The piece is a good fit for business publications like Fortune or Mashable. </p>
