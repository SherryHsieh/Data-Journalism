<h1>Project Pitch (revised)</h1>
<head>Retail Trouble, mining SEC filings</head>
	<p>Recent years, as shoppers migrate to the web, retail bankrupticies have grab headlines. From American Apparel to Coldwater Creek to Brookstone, case after case foreshadows more store closures to come. Teen clothing retailers are especially hard it. Teenagers are spending more on elecronics and food than clothing <a href="https://nrf.com/media/press-releases/demand-clothing-supplies-electronics-drives-schoolcollege-spending">see article</a>.   
	</p>

	<p>In this article, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/business/retailers-ask-where-did-teenagers-go.html?_r=0">"Retailers Ask: Where did Teenagers Go?"</a> spending decline is attributed to e-commerce and fast-fashoin companies like Forever 21 and H&M. But is there something more to the story? Was there any tell-tale sign that these retailers were in trouble, say 3 years ago? 
	</p>

	<p>Using data scrapped from each teen clothing retailer's most recent 10K annual report (and possibly going 3 or 5 years back): <a href="http://investors.ae.com/investor-information/default.aspx">American Eagle SEC filings,</a> <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=131103&p=irol-sec">Aeropostale SEC filings,</a> <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=61701&p=irol-sec">Abercrombie&Fitch SEC filings,</a> and <a href="http://ir.wetsealinc.com/sec.cfm?DocType=Annual&Year=">Wet Seal</a>, I would like to find out if each company's annual report had shown signs of trouble before eventual bankruptcy or restructuring took place. 
	</p>

	<p>What I need from 10K:
		<table style="width:100%">
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>Current Assets</td>
				<td>Long-Term Assets</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Current Liabilities</td>
				<td>Long-term Liabilities</td>
			</tr>
	</p>
	<p>I need to pay attention to sales, revenue, long-term debt</p>

	As e-commerce continues to evolve (yes, we've all read stories about shopping with big data, take a look at this Bloomberg story, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-03/retailers-use-big-data-to-turn-you-into-a-big-spender.html">"Retailers Use Big Data to Turn You into a Big Spender"</a>), could retailers, both with physical stores and online, avoid the fate of the aforementioned teen cloting retailers? 

	The piece is a good fit for business publications like Fortune, Bloomberg.
