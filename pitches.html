<h1>Project re-Pitched: Barbie sales and population</h1>
<h3>How relevant is the 55-year-old Barbie?</h3>

<p>
	Barbie, marketed to children that are between age 3 and 9, was first introduced by Mattel in 1959 and sold for $3. In the first year, 300,000 Barbie dolls were sold. The company went public in 1960. But in recent years, sales of Barbie (Mattel's biggest product line) has decreased. Using data from <a href="http://www.census.gov/population/age/">US census bureau</a> and information from SEC filings (starting 1994), I would like to see if Barbie doll sales decline corresponds with the number of girls ages 3 to 9. 
</p>

<p>
	To do so, I will have to scrap data from population reports. But because reports do not specity age, only age group, I have to do some number crunching. For example, I have the sex ratio of births in 2002, there were rougly 2 million male and <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr52/nvsr52_10.pdf">1,963,747 female newborns</a>. 
</p>

<p>
	What does the number, 1,963,747, translates to? In 2005, we will have 1,963,747 three-year-olds (similarly, it is the number of four-year-old in 2006, five-year-old in 2007, six-year-old in 2008, seven-year-old in 2009, eight-year-old in 2010 and nine-year-old in 2011). This is how I will calculate my age group, 3 to 9, each year from 1994 to 2014.

	I will present my story as a blog post, and visualize my data as bascic bar graphs.

<p>The piece is a good fit for business publications like Fortune or Mashable. </p>
