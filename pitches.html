<h1>Project re-Pitched: Another Look at Crumbs</h1>
<h3>Could social media app Yelp have predicted Crumbs' bankruptcy?</h3>

	<p>In recent years, social media platforms like Yelp, Twitter have contributed to the erosion of food critics and the rise of self-proclaimed foodies. The Millennials, a demographic of nearly 75 million people wield significant purchasing power, including restaurants.  <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-economy/solutions-bank/the-secret-financial-habits-and-economic-prospects-of-millennials-20140903">(see article)</a>.   

	<p>But more important than spending, to Millennials, food and eating are shareable experiences. </P>

	<p>According to an article published on Mic, <a href="http://mic.com/articles/39645/how-millennials-became-the-foodie-generation">"How Millennials Became the Foodie Generation,"</a> the Millennials "eat" like this:

	<p>First, they check-in using Facebook, FourSquare. Then, they photograph the meal and share that meal Instagram. Finally, they complete the meal by uploading a Yelp review. </p> 
 

	<p>I am curious to find out if Yelp reveiwers could have predicted Crumbs Bake Shop's decline before the market spotted the cupcake shop's trouble. By scraping reviews from Yelp and previous <a href="http://investors.crumbs.com/sec.cfm">SEC filings</a> from Crumbs, I want to find out the following:</p>
	<p>
		1. Did Yelp reviews, number of postive versus negative reviews coincided with how the company was doing financially? For example, if Crumbs reported weak earning in 2013, were reviews on Yelp also unfavorable?</p>
	<p>
		2. If my first point proves to be true, then Yelp reviews for Crumbs' two still-open store located in Garment Center (1385 Broadway) and Times Square (261 W. 42nd Street) can forecast how healthy the newly opened Crumbs is. <a href="http://www.crumbs.com/locations/">(New York store locations)</a> Furthermore, data from Yelp will also indicate how successful Crumbs' restructuring has been. Will the new Crumbs, which has added options like gluten-free and Girl Scouts cookie flavor cupcakes, be profitable? </p>
